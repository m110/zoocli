# zoocli
Interactive command line tool for [Apache ZooKeeper](https://zookeeper.apache.org/).

**Note that this is alpha software.**

## Featuring:

* Basic and advanced operations.
* Clear interface.
* Better nodes listing.
* In-place edit of node's data.
* Full readline support with tab completions and searchable history.
* ...and more!

## Why?

Because I couldn't find interactive CLI that would suit my needs.

## Requirements

* [Python 3](http://python.org)
* [climb](https://github.com/m110/climb)
* [kazoo](https://github.com/python-zk/kazoo/)

## Installation

```
pip3 install zoocli
```

or get the source and run:

```
python3 setup.py install
```

Then update config file to match your preferences.
```
cp /etc/zoocli/zoocli.conf.example /etc/zoocli/zoocli.conf
```

# Usage

## Navigation

Use `cd` and `ls` commands to list nodes and move around.

```
[/]> cd zookeeper
[/zookeeper]> ls
one two three
[/zookeeper]> ls -l one
foo
bar
baz
```

## Management

* `cd <path>` - change current directory
* `ls [-l] <path>` - list child nodes
* `get <path>` - display node's data
* `set <path> <data>` - set node's data
* `$EDITOR <path>` - edit node's data in-place with your favorite editor
* `create [-eps] <path> [data]` - create new node
* `rm [-r] <path>` - remove node
* `stat <path>` - get detailed information about node
* `getacl <path>` - get node's ACL
* `addacl <path> <permissions> <scheme> <id>` - add ACL to node
* `rmacl <path> <index>` - delete node's ACL
* `find <path> [-name pattern]` - find all sub-nodes

# Configuration

zoocli will attempt to read `./zoocli.conf`, `~/.zoocli.conf` and `/etc/zoocli/zoocli.conf` in that order.

Here is the configuration file explained.
```ini
[zoocli]
# Your favorite editor - this name will act as a command!
editor = vim
# Commands history file. Leave empty to disable.
history = ~/.zoocli_history
# Additional verbosity, if needed.
verbose = off

[zookeeper]
# In case of more hosts, use comma-separated values.
hosts = zk1:2181,zk2:2181
# Optional credentials
user =
password =
```

# Tips

## Batch mode

Any command can be passed directly as arguments to zoocli, which will exit just after after executing it. If you run it without arguments, you will get to interactive mode (preferable choice in most cases).

# Examples

Adding ACLs:

```
[/]> create any_node
Created: /any_node

[/]> addacl /any_node cdrw digest admin:password
Added ACL to /any_node: digest:admin:password (cdrw)

[/]> addacl /any_node rw ip 127.0.0.1
Added ACL to /any_node: ip:127.0.0.1 (rw)

[/]> addacl /any_node r world anyone
Added ACL to /any_node: world:anyone (r)

[/]> getacl /any_node
0: world anyone (ALL)
1: digest admin:bjkZ9W+M82HUZ9xb8/Oy4cmJGfg= (READ, WRITE, CREATE, DELETE)
2: ip 127.0.0.1 (READ, WRITE)
3: world anyone (READ)

[/]> rmacl /any_node 0
Deleted ACL from /any_node: world anyone

[/]> getacl /any_node
0: digest admin:bjkZ9W+M82HUZ9xb8/Oy4cmJGfg= (READ, WRITE, CREATE, DELETE)
1: ip 127.0.0.1 (READ, WRITE)
2: world anyone (READ)
```
